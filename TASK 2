Develop a Python program to track and manage student grades. The program should allow the user to input grades for different subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade,
and display the overall grade along with any additional information (such as letter grade or GPA).
def calculate_letter_grade(average):
    if average >= 90:
        return 'A', 4.0
    elif average >= 80:
        return 'B', 3.0
    elif average >= 70:
        return 'C', 2.0
    elif average >= 60:
        return 'D', 1.0
    else:
        return 'F', 0.0

def main():
    grades = {}
    subjects = int(input("Enter the number of subjects: "))

    for i in range(subjects):
        subject_name = input(f"Enter the name of subject {i+1}: ")
        grade = float(input(f"Enter the grade for {subject_name}: "))
        grades[subject_name] = grade

    total = sum(grades.values())
    average = total / subjects

    letter_grade, gpa = calculate_letter_grade(average)

    print("\n--- Grade Summary ---")
    for subject, grade in grades.items():
        print(f"{subject}: {grade}")

    print(f"\nOverall Average: {average:.2f}")
    print(f"Letter Grade: {letter_grade}")
    print(f"GPA: {gpa:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
